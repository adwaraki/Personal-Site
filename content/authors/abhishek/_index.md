## About Me

My name is Abhishek Dwaraki and I am a research engineer at Washington University in St. Louis. My research interests lie at the intersection of programmable networking, high-performance computing, and distributed systems.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Visveswaraiah Technological University in India, and then went on to complete my Master's and Doctoral degrees in Computer Engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Throughout my academic career, I have worked on a variety of research projects related to network virtualization, software-defined networking, and distributed systems. My work has been published in several conferences and journals.

When I'm not researching, I enjoy reading books, amateur photography and spending time outdoors hiking and camping. Feel free to get in touch with me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations.
